# Translations

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to suggest changes or help translate our projects, please do so via [Crowdin](https://intellectualsites.crowdin.com). This project is just read-only.

## How to install
All translations are located under `<project>/<language>`. If you can place additional language files alongside another or need to override the existing one depends on the project and its configuration (specifically, if you can specify the language in the config itself).
